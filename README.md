# 18-Social-Network-API

## Description

This project is an attempt to create a NoSQL database based on users & thoughts using MongoDB. This project was constructed with numerous routes to create, read, update & delete users, friends, thoughts & reactions within a NoSQL database. Utilizing MongoDB for this project helps the database become much more flexible and become an easier way to store irregularly shaped data. Express.js was also an integral technology used in the creation of this project.
